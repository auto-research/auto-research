# Auto Research Static Site

This repository hosts a simple static HTML website for GitHub Pages.
All site files are located in the `docs` directory so that GitHub
Pages can serve them automatically.

## Structure

- `docs/index.html` – main page
- `docs/assets/css/style.css` – styles
- `docs/assets/js/script.js` – JavaScript
- `docs/assets/img/` – place images here

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser or enable GitHub Pages with the
"Deploy from `docs/`" option to serve the site.
