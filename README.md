# Auto Research Static Site

This repository hosts a simple static HTML website. The site files are located in the repository root and the `assets` directory.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page
- `assets/css/style.css` – styles
- `assets/js/script.js` – JavaScript
- `assets/img/` – place images here

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser or configure a static site host (e.g. GitHub Pages) to serve it.
